A blind spot in a vehicle is an area around the vehicle that cannot be directly seen by the driver while at the controls, under existing circumstances. Commoners are usually unaware of blind spot. So they are more prone to accidents when they disobey traffic rules road safety measures.

The driver visibility is the maximum distance at which driver can identify prominent objects around the vehicle, primarily determined by weather condition and vehicle design. In India, thousands to lakh of people are killed in road accidents more likely due to blind spots. Hence there is a need of blind spot monitoring system. When a car or bike enters the blind spot of heavy vehicle, the heavy vehicle driver will be notified through an voice note. The vehicle in the blind spot will be warned through LED matrix, which is placed in the view of vehicle's blind spot that will flash a warning message when detected, thus alerting the bike or car of the danger.

We believe that our project could help prevent more number of accidents by providing an automatic warning to those cars or bike in vehicles blind spot ,the dangerous position. So, in case of the heavy vehicle being unaware, those in danger can take action.
